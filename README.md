# Systems on Serverless
_Thoughts, questions, articles about building entire systems on a serverless backbone_

## Background

My aim is to work out what is needed to build an application **entriely** on a serverless background.

It is broken down into the following sections:

### State

How do we persist the information that the system needs to perform its processing in an intrinsically stateless environment?

### Triggers

How do we get our system to respond to inputs from the outside?

### Communication

How do different parts of a system communicate with each other?

### Modeling

How do we get an overview of the system that we can use to model its architecture and its likely behaviour?

### Security

How do we control access in a system that doesn't really have a perimeter?
